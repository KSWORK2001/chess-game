# chess-game

This program is a real representation of chess. The program does not have a GUI but the board is represented in command line format. Currently, I am working on creating a AI player for the game.The AI will run on a set number of algorithms to play Chess. The AI will adapt to the payer moves and adjust difficulty accordingly.

Langiage: Python 3.8.15

Environment: Pycharm

Remarks: AI is still being made so the game is unplayable at this point.
